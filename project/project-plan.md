# Project Plan

## Title

**Climate Change Analysis: Investigating the Impact of Surface Temperature and Land Cover Changes on Forest Carbon Stocks and Climate-Related Disasters**

## Main Questions

1. **Carbon and Temperature Correlation**: Is there a correlation between changes in forest carbon stocks and surface temperature changes over the decades globally and regionally?
2. **Disasters and Land Cover Changes**: How do changes in land cover influence the frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters across different regions?
3. **Integrated Impact Assessment**: What is the overall impact of rising surface temperatures and land cover changes on forest carbon stocks and the frequency of climate-related disasters?

## Description

This project aims to analyze the interrelationships between climate change metricsâ€”namely annual surface temperature changes, forest carbon stocks, land cover changes, and the frequency of climate-related disasters. Utilizing datasets spanning several decades, the project seeks to identify trends and correlations that can help predict future environmental conditions and inform policy decisions.

The approach involves merging data from four distinct but interconnected datasets. By examining the relationships between surface temperature changes, forest carbon stocks, land cover changes, and disaster frequencies, the project aims to create a holistic view of climate dynamics. Advanced statistical models will be employed to identify patterns and predict future trends. This project not only contributes to our understanding of how different climate-related factors are interlinked but also supports the development of targeted climate resilience and mitigation strategies.
